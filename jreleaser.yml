  longDescription: |
    The JBang Gradle plugin allows JBang scripts to be executed during a Gradle build.
    The plugin attempts to use an existing JBang installation. If no JBang installation is found, the plugin will install
    JBang by downloading and caching the latest version binaries (in your local Gradle cache directory) for subsequent runs.
